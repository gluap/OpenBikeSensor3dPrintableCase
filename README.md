# Making/Contributing your own changes
The files for 3D Printing are in the ``.stl`` format. But these are discretized versions of more universal
3D Geometry that can be read and edited by CAD software.

This is a grown project and in the past contributions have been made with different CAD Programs. We would
love to go full Open Source and use Freecad and OpenSCAD exclusively instead of commercial solutions, but a lot of the
case design is still done in software by the big players. Some parts were designed/modified in Autodesk inventor
(filenames ``*.ipt``), some were designed in Fusion360 (filenames ``*.f3d``), but for most parts a step file
(``*.stp, *.step``) is available which can be opened by most CAD Programs. For your contributions in CAD software
of your choice it would be great if you could also follow the practice of submitting your changes in both
``.stl`` for 3D-Printing and ``.step`` for later editing - and maybe the native format of your CAD software on
top.

OpenSCAD is a special case of course: Here submitting ``.stl`` and the ``.scad`` file is sufficient.
